#### How to run SSIPe as standalone program? ####

[1] Make your input folder. The PDB format complex structure you want to analyze
    is named "complex.pdb". The list of mutations should be listed in 
    "mutList.txt" in FoldX individual list format:
    	
        QA22D;
        EB12Y;
	HA18F,QA22D;

[2] The main script that calculate the free energy is "get_final_score.py", "
get_final_score2.py" and/or "get_final_score3.py". The three scripts use different
force fields to calculate the scores. "get_final_score.py" uses evolutionary profile
and physical energy combined force field (SSIPE), "get_final_score2.py" uses only
evolutionary profile force field (SSIP), and "get_final_score3.py" uses only physics-
based force field (EvoEF). Based on our benchmark, using the SSIPE score can achieve
the highest accurary, while using EvoEF can achieve the highest speed with sufficiently
good accuracy.
    run the following command to make the prediction:

        get_final_score.py data_dir
        get_final_score2.py data_dir
        get_final_score3.py data_dir

    Where "data_dir" is your input folder as prepared in [1]. The final result
    will be available at "result.txt" and "index.html".
