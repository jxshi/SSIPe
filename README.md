# SSIPe
SSIPe is a method to calculate binding free-energy changes (ΔΔGbind) of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) upon mutations at protein-protein interface. Starting from a PPI complex structure, SSPIe first generates multple structure and sequence alignments from PDB and STRING databases separately. The structural and sequence profiles are then combined with the physical energy function EvoEF to predict the impact of the mutations on PPI binding free energies. SSIPe can be used to guide the designing and engineering of protein-protein interactions with enhanced binding affinity, and/or for understanding the roles of disease-related mutations associated with protein-protein interactions.
