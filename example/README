This is an example to show how to run SSIPe to get ddG prediction.

Run the following command line:
  ../run_SSIPe.pl -pdb complex.pdb -mulist mutList.txt -forcefield SSIPE -isscore 0.5 > SSIPe.log 2>&1 &
or:
  ../run_SSIPe.pl -pdb complex.pdb -mulist mutList.txt -forcefield SSIP -isscore 0.5 > SSIPe.log 2>&1 &
or:
  ../run_SSIPe.pl -pdb complex.pdb -mulist mutList.txt -forcefield EVOEF -isscore 0.5 > SSIPe.log 2>&1 &

After the calculation is finished, the ddG result will be presented in the 'result.txt' file.
If running the 1st or the 3rd command line, the mutant models will be constructed using EvoEF.
